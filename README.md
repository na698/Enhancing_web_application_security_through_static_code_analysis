### Project: Enhancing Web Application Security through Static Code Analysis 

This project is a single-page interactive dashboard that serves as a central hub for a static code analysis (SCA) initiative. It translates a formal Project Requirement Document (PRD) into a dynamic and highly consumable format, making complex security concepts and processes accessible to all project stakeholders.

#### What We Did:
**Designed a Unified Dashboard:** We created a user-friendly, single-page web application to visualize and manage the security posture of a web application. This moves the focus from static reports to a dynamic, interactive experience.
**Simulated an Automated DevSecOps Workflow:** The application demonstrates a proactive security workflow, showing how vulnerabilities are identified early in the development lifecycle before they can reach production.
**Developed Interactive Tools:** The dashboard includes several functional assistants that simulate advanced security tasks, providing immediate feedback and guidance for different user roles.
**Ensured Full Portability:** The entire application is self-contained in a single HTML file. It uses hardcoded data to simulate API responses, ensuring that all features, including the interactive tools and visualizations, work reliably offline without any external dependencies.

#### Key Tools & Technologies Used:
**Frontend:** HTML, Tailwind CSS, and vanilla JavaScript for a modern, responsive user interface.
**Data Visualization:** Chart.js for creating clear and dynamic charts.
**Core Logic:** JavaScript for handling all user interactions and state management.

#### Implementation & Output:
The final deliverable is a single, complete HTML file that can be opened in any web browser. This file contains the entire application, including its structure, styling, data, and interactive logic. It serves as a powerful proof-of-concept, demonstrating how an interactive dashboard can enhance the collaboration and efficiency of a web security project.

The dashboard's key output includes:
- A visual representation of the proactive security model.
- An interactive step-by-step guide to the security workflow.
- On-demand security analysis and remediation plans for code snippets.
- A tool for generating formal security alert messages.
- A simple project timeline generator for resource planning.
